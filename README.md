# Flex

An account budgeting app designed at VT Hacks III

See where you're spending. A better budgeting tool for your expenses.

Traditional bank and credit card statements inform you of your past expenditures. These documents provide no deep understanding of the way you spend your money. Flex is not a bank statement, it's your new personal advisor.

With Flex, users can see so much more than a statement. Users can see their recent purchases mapped out and can find where they spend the most money.
